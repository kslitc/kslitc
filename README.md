# Hi there 👋

## :face_in_clouds: About me 🚀

⚡ I am Keren Sánchez, a **QA Automation Engineer** (specialized in **Back End** testing) with background as a **Developer**.

🌍 I enjoy learning new things about technology. That's why, despite having a strong background in **Java**, lately I'm focusing on **Python**. I love **REST API** testing, but I have also worked with **SOAP**, **Message Queuing** and **Selenium**. Other than that, I try to apply **BDD** whenever possible to provide comprehensible feedback about test results easily.
